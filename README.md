## 📖 Overview

This CRM system leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to enhance productivity and customer engagement through features like intelligent lead scoring, customer communication, and performance tracking.

Traditional CRM systems lack adaptive intelligence. By integrating **Natural Language Processing**, **KNN**, and **Neural Networks**, this system dynamically learns user behavior and adapts to changing business requirements.

---

## 🚀 Motivation

- Traditional CRMs lack automation and real-time decision-making.
- AI improves prediction accuracy, automates responses, and enables smarter insights.
- Enhances team productivity and customer experience.
